(a) Table 3.2.3.1.-B or Table 3.2.3.1.-C for an exposing building face conforming to Article 3.2.3.2. of a building or fire
compartment which is not sprinklered , or
(b) Table 3.2.3.1.-D or Table 3.2.3.1.-E for an exposing building face conforming to Article 3.2.3.2. of a sprinklered fire
compartment that is part of a building which is sprinklered in conformance with Section 3.2.
(See Note A-3)
(See also Article 3.1.18.3.)
```
```
(2) The area of the unprotected openings in an exposing building face shall be the aggregate area of unprotected
openings expressed as a percentage of the area of the exposing building face in Table 3.2.3.1.-B, 3.2.3.1.-C, 3.2.3.1.-D or
3.2.3.1.-E. (See Sentence 3.2.3.2.(1))
```
```
(3) For the purpose of determining the type of construction and cladding and the fire-resistance rating of an exterior
wall,
(a) the exposing building face shall be taken as the projection of the exterior wall onto a vertical plane located so that no
portion of the exterior wall of the building or of a fire compartment , if the fire compartment complies with the
requirements of Article 3.2.3.2., is between the vertical plane and the line to which the limiting distance is measured,
and
(b) the area of unprotected openings shall be determined from Table 3.2.3.1.-B, 3.2.3.1.-C, 3.2.3.1.-D or 3.2.3.1.-E.
```
```
(4) For the purpose of determining the actual percentage of unprotected openings permitted in an exterior wall, the
location of the exposing building face is permitted to be taken at a vertical plane located so that there are no unprotected
openings between the vertical plane and the line to which the limiting distance is measured. (See Note A-3.2.3.1.(4))
```
```
(5) Except for buildings that are sprinklered , where the limiting distance is 2 m or less, individual unprotected openings
in an exposing building face shall be no greater than
(a) the area stated in Table 3.2.3.1.-A, or
(b) where the limiting distance equal to or greater than 1.2 m, the area calculated by
```
```
Area = 0.24 [(2 x LD) - 1.2]^2

room or space, or
(b) 2 m vertically of another _unprotected opening_ that serves the single room or space, or another room or space on the
same _storey_.

**(7)** For the purpose of Sentence (6), “single room or space” means a room or space that
(a) is not divided by a wall,
(b) is divided by

(8) If a building has any storey that is not sprinklered and firefighting facilities cannot reach it within 10 min of the
alarm being received, the required limiting distance shall be doubled.

(9) If the surface temperature on the unexposed surface of a wall assembly exceeds the temperature limit of a standard
fire test as permitted by Article 3.1.7.2., an allowance shall be made for the radiation from the hot unexposed wall surface
by adding an equivalent area of unprotected opening to the area of actual openings as follows:

Te = 892°C for a _fire-resistance rating_ not less than 45 min, 927°C for a _fire-resistance rating_ not less than
1 h, and 1 010°C for a _fire-resistance rating_ not less than 2 h.


3.2.3.1. 2024 Building CodeCompendium

```
(10) Unless a closure used to protect an opening in an exposing building face has a protective performance equivalent to
that required for the wall assembly in which it is located, an equivalent area of unprotected opening , determined in
accordance with the procedures of Sentence (9) shall be added to the greater of
(a) the actual area of unprotected openings , or
(b) the corrected area of unprotected openings.
```
```
(11) The required limiting distance for an exposing building face is permitted to be measured to a point beyond the
property line that is not the centre line of a street , lane or public thoroughfare if
(a) the owners of the properties on which the limiting distance is measured and the municipality enter into an agreement
in which such owners agree that,
(i) each owner covenants that, for the benefit of land owned by the other covenantors, the owner will not
construct a building on his or her property unless the limiting distance for exposing building faces in respect
of the proposed construction is measured in accordance with the agreement,
(ii) the covenants contained in the agreement are intended to run with the lands, and the agreement shall be
binding on the parties and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns,
(iii) the agreement shall not be amended or deleted from title without the consent of the municipality , and
(iv) they will comply with such other conditions as the municipality considers necessary, including
indemnification of the municipality by the other parties, and
(b) the agreement referred to in Clause (a) is registered against the title of the properties to which it applies.
```
```
(12) Where an agreement referred to in Sentence (11) is registered against the title of a property, the limiting distance for
exposing building faces shall be measured to the point referred to in the agreement.

####### 3.2.3.2. Area of Exposing Building Face

```
(1) Except as permitted by Sentences (2) and (3), the area of an exposing building face shall be calculated as the total
area of exterior wall facing in one direction on any side of a building measured from the finished ground level to the
uppermost ceiling.
```

3.2.3.2. 2024 Building CodeCompendium

```
(2) If a building is divided by fire separations into fire compartments , the area of exposing building face is permitted to
be calculated for each fire compartment provided the fire separations have a fire-resistance rating not less than 45 min.
```
```
(3) In a building that is sprinklered throughout and contains an interconnected floor space , the area of the exposing
building face for the interconnected floor space is permitted to be determined by considering each storey as a separate fire
compartment notwithstanding openings through the floor assemblies.
```
####### 3.2.3.3. Wall Enclosing Attic or Roof Space

```
(1) An exterior wall enclosing an attic or roof space and located above an exposing building face , shall be constructed
in conformance with the requirements for the exposing building face.

####### 3.2.3.4. Reserved

####### 3.2.3.5. Wall With Limiting Distance Less Than 1.2 m

```
(1) Openings in a wall that has a limiting distance less than 1.2 m shall be protected by closures whose fire-protection
rating is in conformance with the fire-resistance rating required for the wall.
```
```
(2) Wired glass or glass block shall not be used for a closure referred to in Sentence (1).
```
####### 3.2.3.6. Combustible Projections

```
(1) Except for a building containing one or two dwelling units only, combustible projections on the exterior of a wall
that could expose an adjacent building to fire spread and are more than 1 m above ground level, including balconies,
platforms, canopies and stairs, shall not be permitted within
(a) 1.2 m of a property line or the centre line of a public way , or
(b) 2.4 m of a combustible projection on another building on the same property.
```
```
(2) Except as provided in Sentence (4), where the exposing building face has a limiting distance of not more than
0.45 m, projecting roof soffits shall not be constructed above the exposing building face. (See Note A-3.2.3.6.(2))
```
```
(3) Except as provided in Sentence (4), where the exposing building face has a limiting distance of more than 0.45 m,
the face of roof soffits above the exposing building face shall not project to less than 0.45 m from the property line. (See
Note A-3.3.4.6.(2))
```
```
(4) The face of a roof soffit is permitted to project to the property line, where it faces a public way. (See Note A-
9.10.14.5.(11) and 9.10.15.5.(10))
```
```
(5) Where roof soffits project to less than 1.2 m from the centre line of a public way , or from an imaginary line between
two buildings or fire compartments on the same property, they shall
(a) have no openings, and
(b) be protected by
(i) not less than 0.38 mm thick sheet steel,
(ii) unvented aluminum conforming to CAN/CGSB-93.2-M, “Prefinished Aluminum Siding, Soffits and Fascia,
for Residential Use,”
(iii) not less than 12.7 mm thick gypsum soffit board or gypsum ceiling board installed according to
CSA A82.31-M, “Gypsum Board Application,”
(iv) not less than 11 mm thick plywood,
(v) not less than 12.5 mm thick OSB or waferboard, or
(vi) not less than 11 mm thick lumber.
```
```
(6) For buildings of combustible construction , materials installed to provide the required protection of soffits may be
covered with a combustible or noncombustible finish material.
