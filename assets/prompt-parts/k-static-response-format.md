## **Response Format**

You must return your response as a single JSON object. Do not include any additional text, markdown, or commentary outside of the JSON.

### **If providing a final answer to a "Form Question":**

```json
{
  "response_type": "final_answer",
  "form_question_number": "<Number of the form question, e.g., '3.02'>",
  "final_answer": "<The definitive answer you have concluded>",
  "justification": "<A brief explanation, citing the OBC excerpt, for how you arrived at this answer>"
}
```

### **If asking a clarifying question:**

```json
{
  "response_type": "clarifying_question",
  "clarifying_question": "<Your new, concise question for the user>",
  "input_type": "<'multiple_choice' or 'numeric'>",
  "choices": [
    "<Option 1>",
    "<Option 2>",
    "<Option 3>"
  ],
  "unit": "<e.g., 'm', 'mÂ²' - Only for numeric input>",
  "clarifying_question_context": "<Brief context for why this question is being asked, relating it back to the form question>"
}
