```
######### OR1 Water and Energy Conservation

```
An objective of this Code is to limit the probability that, as a result of the design or construction of a
building , a resource will be exposed to an unacceptable risk of depletion. The risks of resource
depletion addressed in this Code are those caused by—
```
```
OR1.1 – the consumption of water
```
```
OR1.2 – the consumption of energy
```
######### OR2 Infrastructure Capacity

```
An objective of this Code is to limit the probability that, as a result of the design or construction of a
building the capacity of the infrastructure supporting the use, treatment or disposal of a resource will be
exposed to an unacceptable risk of being exceeded. The risks of exceeding capacity addressed in this
Code are those caused by—
```
```
OR2.1 – excessive demand on the infrastructure
```

######## OE Environmental Integrity

```
An objective of this Code is to limit the probability that, as a result of the design or construction or operation
of the building , the natural environment will be exposed to an unacceptable risk of degradation
```
######### OE1 Air Quality

```
An objective of this Code is to limit the probability that, as a result of the design or construction of a
building , the natural environment will be exposed to an unacceptable risk of degradation due to
emissions of greenhouse gases into the air. The risks of degradation addressed in this Code are those
caused by—
```
```
OE1.1 – emissions of greenhouse gases into the air
```
```
OE1.2 – the release of contaminants, other than greenhouse gases, into the air
```
######### OE2 Water and Soil Quality

```
An objective of this Code is to limit the probability that, as a result of the design or construction of a
building , the natural environment will be exposed to an unacceptable risk of degradation due to
excessive release of contaminants into water or soil.
```
######## OC Conservation of Buildings

```
An objective of this Code is to limit the probability that, as a result of the extension, material alteration or
repair of an existing building or a change in use of an existing building , the existing building cannot be
acceptably conserved.
