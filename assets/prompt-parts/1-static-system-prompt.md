(11) The required limiting distance for an exposing building face is permited to be measured to a point beyond the property line that is not the centre line of a street, lane or public thoroughfare if

(a)the owners ofthe properties on whichthe limiting distance is measured andthe municipality enter intoan agreement in which such owners agree that,

(i) each owner covenants that, for the benefit of land owned by the other covenantors,the owner will not construct a building on his or her property unless the limiting distance for exposing building faces in respect of the proposed construction is measured in accordance with the agrement,   
(ii) the covenants contained in the agreement are intended to run with the lands,and the agreement shallbe binding on the parties and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns,   
(ii) the agreement shallnot be amended or deleted from title without the consent of the municipality,and
