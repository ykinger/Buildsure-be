Following is guidance for completing information for each type of matrix for
Parts 3 of Ontario Building Code 2024 Data matrix.

3.00 Building Code Version

Confirm the building code and version to which the project is designed by noting the regulation for the issued
building code and the last code amendment regulation.

3.01 Project Type

Identify the Project type as either New Construction, Addition, Renovation, Addition and Renovation, or
Change of Use. Provide a brief description of the project: (e.g. construction of two-storey addition to the east
face)

3.02 Major Occupancy Classification

Identify each of the major occupancy group in the building and describe their use. (e.g. D - Business and
Personal Services / Medical Clinic). Refer to OBC 3.1.2. and to Appendix A to the building code for multiple
major occupancies. Refer also to Hazard Index tables 11.2.1.1.B – 11.2.1.1.N in Part 11 of the building code
and A-3.1.2.1 (1) of Appendix A to the building code for assistance in determining or classifying major
occupancies.

3.03 Superimposed Major Occupancies

Indicate if the building is designed with superimposed major occupancies. If Yes, provide a brief description.
(e.g. Three stories of Group C – Residential, superimposed over one storey of Group E - Retail).

3.04 Building Area

Indicate the building area for existing and new portions of the building and provide a total. Provide a simple
description of the areas (e.g. existing building, east addition). If a portion of the building is to be demolished,
enter in the Existing column only that portion which is to remain, such that the total of the new and existing is
the area of the final project. Refer to building code definitions for building area and gross floor area.

3.05 Gross Floor Area

Indicate the gross floor area for existing and new portions of the building and provide a total. Provide a simple
description of the areas (e.g. existing building, east addition). If a portion of the building is to be demolished,
enter in the Existing column only that portion which is to remain, such that the total of the new and existing is
the gross floor area of the final project. Refer to OBC definitions for building area and gross floor area.

3.06 Mezzanine Area

Note whether there are mezzanines, how many, where and their areas. Provide a simple description of the
areas (e.g. existing building, east addition). If a portion of a mezzanine is to be demolished, enter in the
Existing column only that portion which is to remain, such that the total of the new and existing is the area of
the final mezzanine. Refer to OBC definitions for mezzanine. If there are no mezzanines, enter N/A.

3.07 Building Height

Enter the number of storeys above and below grade, and the building height as defined.

3.08 High Building

Check the appropriate “Yes” or “No” box in regard to whether the building is a high building as defined.

3.09 Number of Streets / Firefighter Access.

Enter number of streets and fire access routes.

3.10 Building Classification

Identify the classification of the building according to 3.2.2. Building Size and Construction Relative to
Occupancy. A building may have different major occupancies but it is generally given one classification with
the most restrictive occupancy governing. However, superimposed occupancies may be separately classified.
List occupancies in the same order as in 3.02.

3.11 Sprinkler System

Obtain information from engineers and check the appropriate boxes.

3.12  Standpipe System

Obtain information from engineers and check the appropriate boxes.

3.13  Fire Alarm Systems

Obtain information from engineers and check the appropriate boxes.

3.14  Water Service/Supply

Obtain information from engineers and check the appropriate boxes.

3.15 Construction Type

Identify the project construction restrictions (“combustible permitted”, “non-combustible required”,
“encapsulated mass timber”) (refer to Building Classification).

Indicate the actual construction (“combustible”, “non-combustible”, “combustible & non-combustible in
combination”, “encapsulated mass timber”, “encapsulated mass timber & non-combustible in combination”)
and whether heavy timber construction is used.

3.16 Importance Category

Check the appropriate box for Importance Category and refer to PT.35 Importance Category and Seismic
Restraint for completion of this section of the building code data matrix. Obtain information as required from a
structural and geotechnical engineer.

3.17 Seismic Category

If using the workbook, take advantage of the Seismic Supplement tab. Pertinent information from this tab
appears on the Part 3 tab.

Provide the seismic category, calculated in accordance with Part 4. In order to establish the seismic category,
obtain information on the importance factor for earthquake loads and effects (based on the importance
category) and the 5% spectral response acceleration values for the relevant periods. Identify the use of
seismic isolation and supplemental energy dissipation systems. Identify if seismic design is required for
elements of structures, non-structural components, and equipment.

3.18 Occupant Load

Provide design information as to the occupancy and occupant load per floor area and the method of
calculation. Note whether the design requires a posted occupant load limit.

3.19 Barrier-free Design

Identify if the building requires barrier-free design, and if not, state the reason for the exception. State the
number of barrier-free entrances and provide an explanation if needed.

3.20 Hazardous Substances

Check appropriate box in regard to hazardous substances to be found in connection with any of the
occupancies in the project.

3.21 Required Fire Resistance Ratings

Enter in the spaces provided, the fire resistance rating required for horizontal assemblies (e.g. floors, roofs
and mezzanines), as well as the supporting members for these.

Indicate where non-combustible construction is used in lieu of ratings (where permitted). Note that the fire
resistance ratings required may change for different major occupancies.

If the table in the matrix will not accommodate all the information, prepare a separate table and/or schematic
plan and cross reference accordingly.

Indicate the listed design numbers (e.g. ULC, cUL, MMAH SB-2) for the horizontal assemblies and their
supporting members in an appropriate location in the construction documents, such as a building assemblies
schedule where the designations can be more readily associated with a location or construction type.

3.22 Spatial Separation

Provide the spatial separation information in the appropriate columns for each building face/compartment as
applicable. Provide a description of the exposing building face (e.g. “West Elevation”, “North Wall, Fire
Compartment 1”) and identify them on the drawings using the same terminology.

Provide the area of unprotected openings, required fire resistance rating, construction type (“combustible
permitted”, “non-combustible required”, “encapsulated mass timber”) and cladding type (“combustible
permitted”, “non-combustible required”).

3.23 Plumbing Fixture Requirements

Provide design information as to the occupancy, occupant load male/female ratio, and water closets required
and provided.

Add plumbing fixture calculations either on the same drawing sheet as the matrix or separately, confirming
that the number of plumbing fixtures provided is not less than required by the occupant loads for the various
occupancies. It may be necessary to provide a breakdown of the various occupancies in order to provide the
required information with clarity. Adapt the matrix to clearly describe the project.

Where there is an occupancy change under Part 11, Section 3.7 applies and may require an adjustment of
the required number of plumbing fixtures due to the change in occupancy or specific use within an occupancy.

Account appropriately for any barrier-free requirements and unisex or universal washrooms.

3.24 Energy Efficiency

State the Compliance Path utilized in the design and indicate both the Climatic Zone and design degree days
below 18 C.

3.25 Sound Transmission Design

Indicate whether there is more than 1 dwelling unit in the building, and if so, which compliance option was
chosen.

3.26 Alternative Solutions

Identify any alternative solutions relied on for the design, and enter other related information including
references to reports or studies that, in your professional judgment, will assist in acceptance of the alternative
solution.

3.27 Notes

Identify any other information that, in your professional judgment, will assist in expediting issuance of the
building permit.
