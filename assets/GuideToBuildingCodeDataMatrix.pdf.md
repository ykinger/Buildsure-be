Summary

This attachment is for the version of PT.03 which references OBC 2024 and came into effect on January 1,
2025.

A building code data matrix presents pertinent selected elements from a detailed code analysis to provide an
overview of the key code factors of the building design to municipal building officials and others. The data
matrices developed by the OAA are templates that are intended to be modified as needed to adequately
present the key building code decisions made in the design of a building.

Following is guidance for completing information for each type of matrix for Parts 2, 3, 9, 10 or 11. Refer also
to general information regarding Suggested Procedures in Practice Tip PT.03.

If there is insufficient space in a matrix for any information, insert additional rows or list the information in a
separate table identifying which item it relates to, and cross-reference to the additional information. Where
more space is provided than is needed, hide or delete the unnecessary rows.

Where using the MS Excel templates (which are available only to OAA members), refer to additional
information in the “Read Me First” tab of the Excel workbook. Where using the MS Word template versions
with MS Word for the Mac, the functional check-boxes may not appear, or may not function properly due to
differences in the software implementation on the two platforms.

Guides

The sections of the guide are organized by OBC Part. Part 3 is presented first. It contains an explanation for
each Part 3 item. This is followed by Part 9, Part 10, Part 11, and Part 2. These sections of the guide include
only information on items that differ from the Part 3 matrix template. For any items not described in these
subsequent individual sections, refer to the information for the completion of a Part 3 matrix. These
abbreviated sections were created to avoid unnecessary duplication. The sections are set in order of
expected frequency of use.

applicable. Provide a description of the exposing building face (e.g. “West Elevation”, “North Wall, Fire
Compartment 1”) and identify them on the drawings using the same terminology.

Provide the area of unprotected openings, required fire resistance rating, construction type (“combustible
permitted”, “non-combustible required”, “encapsulated mass timber”) and cladding type (“combustible
permitted”, “non-combustible required”).

3.23

Plumbing Fixture Requirements

Provide design information as to the occupancy, occupant load male/female ratio, and water closets required
and provided.

Add plumbing fixture calculations either on the same drawing sheet as the matrix or separately, confirming
that the number of plumbing fixtures provided is not less than required by the occupant loads for the various
occupancies. It may be necessary to provide a breakdown of the various occupancies in order to provide the
required information with clarity. Adapt the matrix to clearly describe the project.

Where there is an occupancy change under Part 11, Section 3.7 applies and may require an adjustment of
the required number of plumbing fixtures due to the change in occupancy or specific use within an occupancy.

Account appropriately for any barrier-free requirements and unisex or universal washrooms.
